# MAVLink Bandwidth Test

Mostly taken from https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink/blob/master/examples/bwtest.py, but with the addition of a dummy drone to communicate with.

Change the IP in receiver\_node.py to the server on which sender\_node.py is running.
Run sender\_node.py and then receiver\_node.py.
